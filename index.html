                <h1 class="t3">Why It Matters</h1>

                <p class="t10 p80">
                    To defend your rights, you need an attorney that not only has the training and expertise but also
                    the time to give your case the attention it deserves.
                </p>

                <p class="t10 p80">
                    I pride myself on providing the time and attention it takes to get it right and get my clients the
                    best outcome I can.
                </p>

                <p class="t10 p80">
                    I don't just have the training and experience you want your defender to have - I also know how to
                    listen and make sure I understand your side of the story.
                </p>

                <p class="t10 p80">
                    You want and need a passionate attorney because a criminal conviction can result in:
                    a jail or prison sentence, large monetary fines and fees, probation, loss of your driver's license, travel restrictions, 
                    difficulty with employers, or difficulty finding housing.
